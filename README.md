# AngBlog

Test Angular 5 application. I hope in the future it will be a blog. Now this app can do only few things:
 * There are few main pages in this app so we can navigate between them using app header.
 * We can get list of posts from Firebase database.
 * And main feature, this app uses redux(ngRx).
